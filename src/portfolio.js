    cardDetailedText: "In the role of a Security Architecture team I am mainly responsible to assess applications developed internally. To support the engineering teams I took the lead to plan, develop, implement, and roll out a Secure Product Lifecycle (SPLC) to ensure security is baked into the DNA of our products. This process utilizes various resources from a dynamic and informative questionnaire to enable engineering teams to work independently and learn about security while developing their application, to a report that allows the management to understand the residual risks of the application and helps the team prioritize which mitigations to implement first. This role also innate the responsibility to establish a Security Architecture culture program to raise the awareness about security and train Product and Tech workforce sustainably by using different formats like presentations or guidelines. In order to measure the teams effectivity, I took part in the overall process of establishing meaningful KPIs such as the overall time until an assessment is completed depending on various conditions.",

    cardDetailedText: "We were able to successfully establish the Cyber Security Specialist role in the company with a bottom up approach. I worked closely with with Head of Quality Assurance and Security, the VP Engineering, and Group Leader DevOps to establish a scaling security mindset based on security and privacy by design principles. My main mission was to provide a cyber security strategy to address the ever-changing threat landscape and sustainably improve the security posture of our platform immowelt.de by leveraging a variety of tools like a company-wide Capture-The-Flag to promote gamified learning experiences or processes like an emergency logbook based on parts of the ISO incidence response framework to raise the transparency when an incident occurs or we're affected by a critical vulnerability. Based on the NIST framework, I established a cyber security maturity model which helped me to point out specific areas to improve across the Product and Development department. By combining the knowledge about the company, derived improvements from the security maturity model, and experienced incidents, I was able to significantly reduce the attack surface of the platform by analyzing the deployed infrastructure on more than 100 AWS accounts using Python to pin-point exposed resources.",

    cardDetailedText: "As a DevOps Engineer at Immowelt Hamburg GmbH, I was responsible for a variety of projects and the legacy monolithic platform of immonet.de. These projects were mostly based on automate as much as possible to reduce the workload with the legacy platform. Among other things, this has been accomplished by replacing the legacy Infrastructure-as-Code tool Puppet by a highly modularized Ansible and step-by-step modernising parts of it with loosely coupled microservices. As the manual workload on the legacy platform has been reduced, I took a defining and pioneering role by establishing a DevOps mindset in the engineering team responsible to rebuild Immowelts main product the private property search in a all-in AWS strategy. My personal and company goal was to establish the \"You build it, you run it\" mindset and enable the team to work autonomously, independently, and efficiently with AWS but still maximizing the product scope without sacrificing a timely-reasonable product launch. At a certain point, the team took a leading role with the infrastructure and CI/CD development using Gitlab based products and Terraform (later CDKTF), which enabled me to gain experiences by developing several applications based on Java, Python, Typescript, and various frontend frameworks like Angular and React. The team and I were able to launch the minimum viable version of the private property search after 8 months and completed the feature set after 9 more months.",
